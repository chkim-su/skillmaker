# Architectural Smell Detector

Detects design problems by comparing against established patterns.

## Philosophy

> **"Is this following skillmaker's canonical patterns? If not, why?"**

Compare project structure against known good patterns. Flag deviations, but distinguish between:
- **Deficient**: Should follow canonical pattern
- **Respectable**: Valid domain-specific choice
- **Superior**: Better approach worth learning from

## Smell Catalog

### Smell 1: Ghost Components
```yaml
Pattern: "Agent/skill declared but empty or minimal"
Symptoms:
  - agents/ file with tools: []
  - skills/ with only stub content
  - commands/ with TODO-only body
Detection:
  - tools: [] without documented reason
  - Body < 50 words
  - Contains only TODO/placeholder text
Severity: HIGH
Question: "Is this an agent or just documentation?"
```

### Smell 2: Responsibility Overlap
```yaml
Pattern: "Multiple components doing similar things"
Symptoms:
  - Two agents with 90%+ similar workflows
  - Skills with overlapping trigger conditions
  - Commands that could be combined
Detection:
  - High textual similarity (>80%)
  - Shared skill dependencies
  - Similar input/output patterns
Severity: MEDIUM
Question: "Should these be consolidated?"
```

### Smell 3: Over-Abstraction
```yaml
Pattern: "Single-use patterns extracted unnecessarily"
Symptoms:
  - Skill with only one consumer
  - Agent orchestrating only one other agent
  - Pattern extracted but never reused
Detection:
  - Reference count = 1
  - No documented reuse intention
  - Complexity added for no benefit
Severity: LOW
Question: "Is this abstraction earning its keep?"
```

### Smell 4: Implicit Coupling
```yaml
Pattern: "Undocumented dependencies between components"
Symptoms:
  - Component assumes another exists
  - State files shared without documentation
  - Execution order assumed but not enforced
Detection:
  - References to files/state not declared
  - No dependency documentation
  - Failures when components run independently
Severity: HIGH
Question: "Are dependencies explicit and documented?"
```

### Smell 5: Pattern Violation
```yaml
Pattern: "Not following established conventions"
Symptoms:
  - MCP without daemon pattern
  - Subagent without context isolation
  - Workflow without state management
Detection:
  - Compare against canonical patterns
  - Missing recommended structure
  - Anti-patterns present
Severity: MEDIUM
Question: "Is there a documented reason for deviation?"
```

### Smell 6: Legacy Remnants
```yaml
Pattern: "Old patterns/docs in updated codebase"
Symptoms:
  - References to deprecated approaches
  - Documentation mentioning removed features
  - Code comments about old behavior
Detection:
  - Mentions of plugin.json (legacy)
  - References to removed skills
  - Outdated version numbers
Severity: LOW
Question: "Is this historical documentation or dead code?"
```

### Smell 7: Excessive Hooks
```yaml
Pattern: "Too many hooks for the problem"
Symptoms:
  - 20+ hooks when 5 would suffice
  - Multiple hooks doing similar validation
  - Hook complexity exceeds benefit
Detection:
  - Hook count > reasonable threshold
  - Duplicated logic across hooks
  - Simple rules made complex
Severity: MEDIUM
Question: "Can these be consolidated or simplified?"
```

## Detection Process

### Phase 1: Collect Structure

```
project/
├── agents/ → list and analyze
├── skills/ → list and analyze
├── commands/ → list and analyze
├── hooks/ → analyze hooks.json
└── scripts/ → check for patterns
```

### Phase 2: Apply Smell Detection

For each smell in catalog:
1. Run detection logic
2. Collect evidence
3. Assess severity
4. Generate recommendation

### Phase 3: Compare Against Canonical Patterns

Load and compare:

| Domain | Canonical Skill | Check |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| MCP integration | `mcp-gateway-patterns` | Daemon SSE pattern used? |
| Skill structure | `skill-design` | Progressive disclosure? |
| Agent design | `orchestration-patterns` | Context isolation? |
| Hook enforcement | `hook-templates` | Proper hook types? |
| Workflow state | `workflow-state-patterns` | State management? |

### Phase 4: Classify Deviations

For each deviation found:

```yaml
Deviation:
  component: "{name}"
  canonical_pattern: "{expected}"
  actual_pattern: "{found}"

  classification:
    verdict: Deficient|Respectable|Superior
    evidence:
      - "{why this classification}"

  recommendation:
    if_deficient: "Adopt canonical pattern: {steps}"
    if_respectable: "Document trade-off: {what}"
    if_superior: "Consider adopting: {what}"
```
