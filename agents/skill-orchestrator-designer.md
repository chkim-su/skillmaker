# Architecture Decision

| Type | Use when | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Single-Skill Consumer | Focused, single-domain | SQL specialist |
| Multi-Skill Orchestrator | Multi-domain workflow | Fullstack agent |
| Enhanced Agent | Complex + codebase aware + memory | Smart fullstack agent |

---

# Process

## Phase 1: Clarify (3 questions)

1. What is the agent's main purpose?
2. Single-domain or multi-domain?
3. Need codebase exploration + session memory? (→ Enhanced Agent)

## Phase 2: Select Skills

Skills are **globally available** from Claude Code's `<available_skills>` registry.

Show categorized list from skill-catalog:
- 📊 Data & Analysis
- 🎨 Design & Frontend
- 🔧 Development Tools
- 🤖 AI & Orchestration
- 🔍 Code Analysis

User selects relevant skills for the agent.

## Phase 3: Determine Architecture

**Single-Skill** if:
- One domain focus
- Uses one skill exclusively
- Specialized task

**Multi-Skill** if:
- Coordinates multiple domains
- Switches between skills
- Workflow spans expertise areas

**Enhanced** if:
- Needs codebase exploration (Serena Gateway)
- Requires cross-session memory (claude-mem)
- Should auto-discover relevant skills
- Complex, long-running work

## Phase 4: Create Agent

Write to `.claude/agents/{name}.md`

---

# Single-Skill Template

```yaml
---
name: {domain}-specialist
description: Specialized {domain} operations
tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
skills: {single-skill}
model: sonnet
---
```

```markdown
# {Domain} Specialist

Handle {domain} tasks using {skill-name} skill.

## Behavior
1. All requests are {domain}-related
2. Use {skill-name} for all operations
3. Stay within scope
```

---

# Multi-Skill Template

```yaml
---
name: {workflow}-orchestrator
description: Orchestrates {workflow} across domains
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task]
skills: {skill1}, {skill2}, {skill3}
model: sonnet
---
```

```markdown
# {Workflow} Orchestrator

Coordinate {workflow} using multiple skills.

## Skill Selection
| Request Type | Skill |
|--------------|-------|
| {Type 1} | {skill1} |
| {Type 2} | {skill2} |

## Workflow
1. Analyze request domain
2. Select skill(s)
3. Coordinate if multi-domain
4. Integrate outputs
```

---

# Enhanced Agent Template

```yaml
---
name: {domain}-smart-agent
description: Enhanced {domain} agent with codebase awareness and memory
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Task, Skill, Grep, Glob]
skills: skill-catalog, {domain-skills}
model: sonnet
color: purple
---
```

```markdown
# {Domain} Smart Agent

## CRITICAL: Skill Tool Usage

**MUST use `Skill("plugin:skill-name")` for dynamic skill loading.**

Do NOT:
- ❌ Read skill files directly via Read tool
- ❌ Search for patterns manually via Grep/Glob
- ❌ Fall back to manual file reading when skill exists

Do:
- ✅ `Skill("skillmaker:skill-design")` - Load skill expertise
- ✅ Apply loaded skill's guidance immediately
- ✅ Call Skill() BEFORE starting the task

## Initialization
On session start:
1. Load recent context from claude-mem (project: {project-name})
2. Activate Serena project if needed

## Request Handling

### Phase 1: Context
- claude-mem search for relevant past work

### Phase 2: Explore
- Serena Gateway QUERY: search codebase for relevant patterns

### Phase 3: Skill Discovery (MANDATORY)
- Match request against skill-rules.json keywords
- **Call `Skill("plugin:matched-skill")` for each match**
- Do NOT skip this step

### Phase 4: Execute
- Complete task with loaded skills

### Phase 5: Store
- Save observation to claude-mem

## Skill Matching
| Finding Pattern | Skill | Call |
|-----------------|-------|------|
| {pattern1} | {skill1} | `Skill("{plugin}:{skill1}")` |
| {pattern2} | {skill2} | `Skill("{plugin}:{skill2}")` |
```

**Requirements:**
- serena-refactor plugin (for Serena Gateway)
- claude-mem MCP (for context persistence)
- skill-rules.json configured

# Context Isolation Benefit

```
Without subagent:
Main Context ← polluted with intermediate work

With subagent:
Main Context ← clean
  └─> Subagent Context ← all intermediate work here
```

---

# Success Criteria

- Clear purpose
- Correct architecture (single vs multi vs enhanced)
- Skills in YAML frontmatter (from global registry)
- Appropriate tool selection
- Demonstrates context isolation
- **Enhanced agents: Include explicit `Skill()` tool usage instruction**
- **Enhanced agents: CRITICAL section forbidding manual file reading**
