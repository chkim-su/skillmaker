# MCP Gateway Designer

Design and generate MCP integration systems with proper isolation, workflow enforcement, and standard protocols.

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Discovery (3-5 questions)

1. **MCP Identification**
   - What MCP server will you integrate? (name, source)
   - What tools does it provide? (list main capabilities)

2. **Usage Pattern**
   - How often will this MCP be used? (frequently / occasionally / rarely)
   - Are operations stateful or stateless?

3. **Workflow Requirements**
   - Single operation or multi-phase workflow?
   - Need quality gates between phases?

### Phase 2: Strategy Selection

Based on discovery, recommend isolation strategy:

| Criteria | Agent Gateway | Subprocess Isolation |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Usage frequency | High | Low |
| Token budget | Flexible | Strict |
| Workflow complexity | Multi-phase | Single operation |
| Session continuity | Required | Not needed |
| Startup latency | Unacceptable | Acceptable (5-15s) |

Present recommendation with trade-offs.

### Phase 3: Action Mapping

Map MCP tools to 2-layer protocol:

```
Intent Layer (QUERY/ANALYZE/GENERATE/MODIFY/EXECUTE)
    ↓
Action Layer (MCP-specific tool names)
    ↓
Effect (READ_ONLY/MUTATING/EXTERNAL_EXEC)
    ↓
Artifact (TEXT/JSON/CODE_PY/CODE_TS/PATCH/BINARY)
```

Create action mapping table for user confirmation.

### Phase 4: Generate Implementation

Based on strategy, generate:

**For Agent Gateway:**
- `agents/{mcp}-gateway.md` - Gateway agent definition
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Workflow hooks (if multi-phase)
- Action mapping reference doc

**For Subprocess Isolation:**
- `config/{mcp}.mcp.json` - Isolated MCP config
- `scripts/{mcp}_gateway.py` - Python wrapper
- Instructions for disabling MCP in main session

**For Both:**
- Consumer agent template
- Request/response examples

## Templates

### Agent Gateway Template

```markdown
---
name: {mcp}-gateway
description: Central gateway for {MCP_DISPLAY_NAME} MCP tools
tools: [{mcp_tools_list}]
model: sonnet
---

# {MCP_DISPLAY_NAME} Gateway

[Generated gateway content based on mcp-gateway-patterns skill]
```

### Subprocess Config Template

`config/{mcp}.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "{mcp}": {
      "command": "{command}",
      "args": {args_array}
    }
  }
}
```

### Hook Template (for multi-phase workflows)

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "preToolUse",
      "matcher": "Task",
      "pattern": "{mcp}.*executor",
      "command": "{gate_check}",
      "behavior": "block",
      "message": "{violation_message}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Checklist

Before completion, verify:

- [ ] Strategy justified with trade-offs
- [ ] All MCP tools mapped to Intent/Action/Effect/Artifact
- [ ] Gateway agent or Python script generated
- [ ] Request/response examples provided
- [ ] Consumer agent template generated
- [ ] Hooks configured (if workflow required)
- [ ] Setup instructions clear

---

## Integration Notes

### With Existing skillmaker Components

- Use `orchestration-patterns` for multi-agent architecture
- Use `skill-orchestrator-designer` if consumer agents need skills

### Testing Guidance

After generation:
1. **Agent Gateway**: Test via Task tool call
2. **Subprocess**: Test via `python3 scripts/{mcp}_gateway.py -r '{...}'`
3. **Hooks**: Verify gate enforcement with intentional violations

## Error Handling

If MCP info is insufficient:
1. Ask for MCP documentation URL
2. Or ask for list of available tools
3. Generate partial design, mark unknowns for user to fill
