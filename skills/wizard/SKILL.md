# Wizard Skill

Smart routing for plugin development with complexity-based skill loading.

## Self-Enforcement (W028 Compliance)

All MUST/CRITICAL keywords are hookified via `hooks/hooks.json`:
- `PreToolUse/PostToolUse → validate_all.py`
- `PostToolUse:Task → solution-synthesis-gate.py`

---

## Complexity Detection

| Level | Keywords | Skills to Load |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Simple** | simple, basic | skill-design |
| **Standard** | standard, normal | + orchestration-patterns, hook-templates |
| **Advanced** | advanced, complex, serena, mcp | ALL pattern skills |

If no keyword detected, ask:
```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Select project complexity"
  header: "Complexity"
  options:
    - label: "Simple"
    - label: "Standard (Recommended)"
    - label: "Advanced"
```

Route selection to corresponding reference file.

## Common Post-Action Steps

After any creation (SKILL, AGENT, COMMAND):

### Validation (MANDATORY)
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate_all.py --json
```

- **status="fail"**: Show errors, ask for auto-fix
- **status="warn"**: Show warnings, allow proceed
- **status="pass"**: Continue to next steps

### Next Steps Template
```markdown
1. **Local Register**: `/wizard register`
2. **Test**: Restart Claude Code → Test functionality
3. **Publish**: `/wizard publish`
```
